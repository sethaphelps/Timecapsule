# Timecapsule

## Description

In this project, we worked as a group to create an interactive and responsive application where a user can create or log into an account that will save their journal entries and attached photos. After logging in, the user is taken to their profile page where they can create a new entry, access their previous ones, or access their image library. When creating a new entry, the current date is automatically included in the data. Within the entry list page, the user has the capability of deleting unwanted notes. And through the image library page, users can access their entries for each corresponding image. 


## Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express.js 

- Handlebars.js as the templating engine

- MySQL database and Sequelize ORM

- GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data

- Heroku deployment (with data)

- A new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed in class

- A folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm

- User authentication (express-session and cookies)

- Environment variables to protect API keys and sensitive information
